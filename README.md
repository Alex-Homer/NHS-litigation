# Cost legacy of decades-old NHS blunders begins to rise

![](https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/vj/live/idt-images/chart-ELSOVER5YRS/ELSOVER5YRS_pserw.png)

In January 2018 the Shared Data Unit [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42442343) the compensation bill for NHS mistakes that took place before 1995 - mainly maternity failings - had begun to rise for the first time in five years.

We discovered new clams were still being submitted for these errors dating back decades. It is thought increased life expectancy and rising care costs also contributed to the rising historical compensation bill.

This was the first piece of content produced by the Shared Data Unit including secondees to the BBC from the regional press: Annette Belcher from the Birmingham Mail, Claire Wilde from the Bradford Telegraph & Argus and Paul Lynch from the Northampton Chronicle & Echo. 

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
