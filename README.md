In January 2018 the Shared Data Hub [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42442343) the compensation bill for NHS mistakes that took place before 1995 - mainly maternity failings - had begun to rise for the first time in five years.

We discovered new clams were still being submitted for these errors dating back decades. It is thought increased life expectancy and rising care costs also contributed to the rising historical compensation bill.

The Shared Data Hub makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
